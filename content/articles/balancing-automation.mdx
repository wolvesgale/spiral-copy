## Start with service principles

Define what a “good” resolution looks like for your customers. This guides decisions around automation boundaries.

## Measure beyond resolution time

Track satisfaction, retention, and tone-of-voice sentiment. Balanced measurements prevent over-optimising for speed alone.
