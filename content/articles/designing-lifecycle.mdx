## Frame the lifecycle by intent

Start by mapping the emotional intent behind each touchpoint. We co-create journey maps with founders to understand when customers need reassurance, confirmation, or motivation.

## Prototype narrative arcs

Translate the intent into narrative arcs. A simple storyboard uncovers whether each message moves the customer forward.

## Operationalise feedback

Ensure each lifecycle stage includes instrumentation. Combine qualitative feedback loops with dashboards, helping teams adjust messaging confidently.
