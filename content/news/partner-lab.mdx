We are hosting **Partner Lab Singapore**, a monthly gathering for product leaders exploring communications-heavy experiences. Each session covers a theme such as onboarding, compliance, or support operations, with lightning talks from the eggs.email team and partner founders.

Spots are limited to ten seats per month to maintain focused discussions.
