Our partner **Ferry** has closed a Series A round led by Horizon Mobility Ventures. The new capital will accelerate geographic expansion, strengthen compliance for urban logistics, and invest in the communications platform we co-developed.

We will continue to provide lifecycle experimentation and growth analytics as Ferry scales across new cities.
