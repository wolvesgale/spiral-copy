We are delighted to introduce the **eggs.email Communications Residency**, an initiative designed to place our specialists within partner teams for concentrated twelve-week engagements. The programme blends lifecycle strategy, service design, and engineering support so founders can sustain growth without sacrificing clarity.

Applications open in September with the first cohort scheduled for Q4.
